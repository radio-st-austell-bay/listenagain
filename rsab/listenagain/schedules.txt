Files in schedule/ must be in CSV format (and must have either 'csv' or 'txt'
extension; the latter is useful for editing in Notepad).  There must be no
heading row.  The 8 columns must be:

1. Day of the week.  One of the following: mon tue wed thu fri sat sun
2. Start time. Format: hhmm
3. End time. Format: hhmm
4. Start padding (override).  This value overrides the global start padding
   configured in the INI file; leave blank to accept the default.  The start
   padding adds time to the start of the show; it's a whole number of seconds.
5. End padding (override).  This value overrides the global end padding
   configured in the INI file; leave blank to accept the default.  The end
   padding adds time to the end of the show; it's a whole number of seconds.
6. Record?  1 to record, or 0 to skip.
7. Show code name.  If the name starts with 'xx' it won't be shown in the
   Listen Again player.  If the name is empty then at least one presenter name
   must be present.
8. Optional list of presenter code names, separated by semicolons.


A file in schedule/ is named after the date on which that schedule comes into
effect.  If there are multiple files, the latest date which is equal to or
earlier than the date under consideration is the one that's used.  The name
format must be YYYY-MM-DD.ext .

A file in schedule/override/ is also named YYYY-MM-DD.ext .  Such a file
applies to that date ONLY, not to all dates which come after it.  If such a
file is present for the date under consideration, files in schedule/ are
ignored.  For convenience, files in schedule/override/ need not include a day
of the week value (but the column must be present; just put a comma before the
start time).  If a day of the week is present, it must be correct for the date
or the row will be ignored.

Lines starting with ; or # are treated as comments and ignored.
